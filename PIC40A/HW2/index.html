                    Pen-beat has become one of my most significant hobbies since grade <br>11. It is an amazing music 
                    style which only requires the movement of <br>the performers' hands and two pens to imitate the 
                    sound of a drum kit. <br>I have been strongly drawn to the charm of pen-beat since I was first<br>
                    introduced to it online. The strong beats and special rhythm deeply <br>attracted me, and ever since,
                    practicing pen-beat has become an essential<br> part of my daily schedule.

                    For other people, pens may be just tools for writing, but for me, they <br>are the key to my 
                    creative side. The random tapping on the table always creates unexpected beautiful <br>sounds, 
                    thus giving me inspirations for new musical creations. Now wherever I go, I plan to maximize<br>
                    my creativity and create the most unique pieces of music with pen-beat.

                    I started to play pool when I was in high school. After I watched the video of the <b>Ronnie O'Sullivan</b>'s Fastest 147<br>
                    in just 5 minutes and 8 seconds, I was totally shocked by how charmful this sports is. Then I began to play pool in a <br>frequency
                    about once a week during my last high school year. However, my skills improved quite slowly due to my lack of practice.
                    Then I went to UCLA, where I practiced playing pool almost everyday with my friend to hone my skills. Although I am a Math
                    major student, I am very <em>proud</em> to that I used to play pool for an average of <strong>at least 4 hours</strong> everyday during my freshman
                    year. That amount of efforts did pay back and I can feel that I am getting better and better after joining the <i>UCLA billiards Club</i>.
