setTimeout function in JavaScript usually takes a callback function as an argument. A callback function is a function that is executed after another function finishes running. In this case, it will run after for loop finishes. At this point, i has the value 11. Due to the closure of JavaScript, the inner code of setTimeout has access to the i = 11, which is defined as an outer layer of the setTimeout. Hence 11 '11' will be added to the paragraph, the page will just display one 11 at a time interval of 110ms and repeat that eleven times, finally with 22 consecutive '1' displayed in the paragraph.
While the let keyword from ES6 creates a separate scope for the code block that allows for loop to print the consecutive variables. So '012345678910' is  the result displayed on the page.
